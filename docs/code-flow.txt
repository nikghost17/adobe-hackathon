For each page in PDF:
  → Extract blocks
     → Extract lines
        → Extract spans
           → Clean and collect span text, font size, and metadata
           → Count frequency of each font size
           → Store all span data in all_spans[]
  ↓
Identify most common font size → mark as body text size
  ↓
Collect all sizes > body size → sort in descending order
  ↓
Map larger font sizes to heading levels (H1, H2, ...)
  ↓
Find title → first largest-font text span on earliest page
  ↓
For each span in all_spans:
  → If size > body size AND (
        is_bold OR
        is_numbered (e.g., "1.2.3") OR
        starts with Capital OR
        ends with colon :
     )
     → Consider it a heading (excluding the title)
     → Assign level (H1/H2/...) based on font size
     → Append to heading list with text and page number
  ↓
Return:
  {
    title: "Extracted title",
    outline: [ {level, text, page}, ... ]
  }
