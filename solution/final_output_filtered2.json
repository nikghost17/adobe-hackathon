Or, they intentionally design a form that you can fill in only by hand or with the Fill & Sign tool. These non-interactive forms are called flat forms. An interactive form contains fields that you can select or fill in. 1. If necessary, select either the Hand Tool or the Select Tool from the context menu of the page (right-click on the page to open the context menu). The pointer changes to a different icon as you move it over a field. For example, tool changes to an I-beam  when you can type text into the form field. Some text fields are dynamic, meaning that they automatically resize to accommodate the amount of data you enter and can span across pages. 2. Select anywhere in the form to access options, such as radio buttons. Select inside a Press Tab to move forward or Shift+Tab to move backward. 3. When finished, submit the form to either send the data to a server or create an email Auto-Complete forms (interactive forms The Auto-Complete feature stores any entries that you type in an interactive form field.

From the hamburger menu, select Preferences (Windows®), or select Acrobat / Acrobat Reader > Preferences (macOS). 2. In the Preferences dialog, select Forms as the preference category. 3. Under Auto-Complete, choose Basic or Advanced from the menu. 4. Select Remember Numerical Data if you want the Auto-Complete memory to store numbers that you type into forms.
